#### Usage
This fake server uses `faker.js` and `json-server` in order to serve up fake data for our front end test.

Run `npm install` inside this directory

Run default server with `npm start`, this will serve up the contents in `db.json`.

You may create a new `db.json` file by running the `generateDB.js` file and adjusting the `numberOfEntries` value contained inside it (minimum number of entries is 5000).

We will be checking the final submission by running generateDB.js again to create new `db.json` file.

You may launch the server with the `db.json` file by running `npm run start`.

#### Data Shapes

    "address": "293 Ova Extensions Koelpinstad New Hampshire, 86680-5255",
    "baths": 1,
    "types": 1,
}
```
